This is an installer for XMage which makes it easier to install and run XMage.

Downloads version 0.3.4, but should automatically update to latest version of XMage.

NB: Currently only works for OSX, but is super simple to update


## Installation

``` 
npm install xmage -g
```

Will automatically download the correct binaries.

Upon first run, it will download a version of java used by XMage.

## Credits

This is really just a simple installer which only makes the installation (and running) a little simpler.
